Aim:
To write a C++ program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

Tools Used:

Programiz (Online C++ compiler)

Visual Studio Code (with C++ extension and GCC compiler)

Theory:
A number is even if it is divisible by 2, i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is zero.
A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2, i.e., the remainder is one.
The modulus operator % is used to get the remainder of a division operation in C++. Conditional statements are used to make the decision.

Algorithm:

1.Start the program.

2.Declare an integer variable.

3.Prompt the user to enter a number.

4.Read the number using cin.

5.Use the modulus operator % to check if the number is divisible by 2.

6.If the remainder is 0, display "Even".

Otherwise, display "Odd".

7.End the program.

Conclusion:
The program was successfully executed to check whether an entered integer is even or odd. It makes use of the modulus operator and conditional statements to determine and display the result.
